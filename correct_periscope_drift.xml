    <SYNOPSIS>
        Correct a Chandra aspect solution for temporal drift calculated from a fit of the
        drift in the sky positions of the events in a supplied circle region.
    </SYNOPSIS>

    <DESC>
      <PARA>
        Thermal cycling on the spacecraft can result in an apparent temporal drift of the sky
        position of an X-ray source during an observation.  This appears as a drift of up to about
        0.5 arcsec in X-ray event sky X, Y coordinates over time.  Because of the thermal
        variation time scales, this effect is usually most prominent in long observations (more
        than about 50 ksec).
      </PARA>
      <PARA>
        As of DS 8.4, a drift correction is applied to the aspect solution using the periscope
        gradients telemetry.  However, temporal drifts have continued to increase with thermal
        variation of the spacecraft.  Therefore the Aspect team suggests that to accomplish
        science related to sub-arcsec source structure, users should follow this thread to correct
        residual drift induced by the periscope.  This requires a relatively bright, on-axis
        source (within
        a few arcmin off-axis angle) to perform a "self-calibration" of the aspect solution.
      </PARA>
      <PARA>
        This tool takes as input a source aspect solution and event files and returns a
        new/corrected aspect solution that may be applied to the events to correct
        residual temporal drift.

            This tool is provides output plots of the fits of the events.  The user
            must evaluate those plots to determine if a correction is warranted and

            The tool is not intended for short observations (less than 50ks) and
